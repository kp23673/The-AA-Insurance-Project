  - **Improving save rates**  
  - **Understanding discount utilization**  
  - **Identifying key factors influencing customer retention**  

- This involves:  
  - Calculating and comparing **save rates** and **discount rates** for specific months  
  - Evaluating **team and agent performance**  
  - Analyzing the impact of **tenure mix** on renewals  
  - Identifying **month-to-month changes** in customer behavior  

- The insights derived from this analysis aim to help the company:

  - **Drive higher renewal rates and long-term loyalty**
    

## Save Rates and Discount Rates for June and July  

- **July** showed **slightly higher save rates and discount rates**, suggesting that **offering more discounts** might have encouraged renewals.  
- The **save rate for the full dataset** is an **average** that includes months with both **higher and lower performance**, whereas the **save rate for July** reflects only a **specific, better-performing period**.  
- **July's performance** likely benefited from factors such as:  
  - **Higher discounts**  
  - **A favorable customer mix**  
  - **Effective retention strategies**

    
## Highest and Lowest Performing Teams and Agents (Save Rate) – June & July  

### **Actionable Findings**  
- **High performers** can share strategies.  
- **Low performers** may need training or additional support.  

### **Recommendations**  
- **Top-performing teams and agents**:  
  - **Teams like Team24** and **agents like Agent47 / Agent244** can share their techniques and strategies through **workshops or mentoring sessions**.  

- **Low-performing teams and agents**:  
  - **Teams like Team22** and **agents like Agent100** should receive **targeted training** on:  
    - **Customer engagement**  
    - **Objection handling**  
    - **Renewal follow-ups**

   
## Impact of Change in Tenure Mix – July vs. June  

### **Impact**  
- The **Tenure Mix Comparison** between **June and July** reveals **notable shifts** in the distribution of customer tenure.  
- **Customers with a tenure of 20 months** represent the **largest segment**, increasing from **24.40% in June to 26.54% in July** (**+2.14% growth**).  
  - This suggests that **long-tenured customers** may be **renewing at a higher rate** or **new renewals** are concentrated in this group.  
- **Declines in newer customers**:  
  - **1-month tenure**: **-1.13%**  
  - **2-month tenure**: **-0.81%**  
  - Indicates **potential challenges in retaining newer customers**.  
- **5-month tenure** group saw a **slight drop** (**-0.64%**), while other mid-tenure customers remained **relatively stable**.  
- These changes highlight a **need for tailored strategies** to:  
  - **Engage newer customers**  
  - **Maintain loyalty among longer-tenured customers**  

### **Recommendations**  
- **Develop targeted onboarding and engagement strategies** for **1–2 month tenure customers** to improve retention.  
- **Enhance onboarding and follow-ups** to **retain newer customers**.  
- **Reward long-tenured customers** to sustain their **loyalty**.  
- **Investigate declines in the 5-month tenure group** for possible issues (e.g., **product dissatisfaction, lack of communication**).  
- **Regularly analyze tenure-based trends** to ensure strategies remain **adaptive** to shifts in customer behavior.
